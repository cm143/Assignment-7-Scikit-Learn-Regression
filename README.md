The purpose of this project was to create three different models (I used ensemble, linear, and svm models) that modled diabetes data. I used datasets.load_diabetes() to load the diabetes data, .data and .target to get the data and labels from the data, model_selection.train_test_split to split the data into testing and sample data, .fit to train the data, .predict to predict the class, .explained_variance_score to find the explained varaince score, .max_error to find the max error, .mean_absolute_error to find the mean absolute error, .mean_squared_error to find the mean squared error, .mean_squared_log_error to find the squared log error, .median_absolute_error to get the median absolute error, .mean_absolute_percentage_error to find the mean absolute percentage error, and .r2_score to find the r2 score of each model. I did not add any limitations to the code.
